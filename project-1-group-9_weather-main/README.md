## 1. Project Title and Description
    - Project Title: Weather App


    - The Weather App is a simple Python application that allows users to retrieve current weather information for a specific location.
    The app utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and presents it to the user via a graphical user interface (GUI)
    built with Tkinter. Users can enter a location, such as a city name, and the app will display details like temperature, 
    weather description, wind speed, and coordinates. The purpose of the Weather App is to provide users with quick access to relevant
    weather information in a user-friendly manner
    
## 2. Installation
    - Dependencies:
    Python 3.x
    Tkinter
    requests
    Pillow (PIL)
    win32com (for Windows only)

    - Installation Instructions: 
    Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your Windows system. If not, download and 
    install it from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
    
    Install Tkinter, which is usually included with Python but might require a separate 
    installation on some systems.
    
    Install the required Python packages using pip. Open a terminal or command prompt and 
    run the following command:
    #Copy code
    'pip install requests Pillow'
    
    Install the win32com package if you haven't already. This package is only required for 
    Windows systems.
    #Copy code
    'pip install pywin32'
    
    Download the project files from the repository.
    
    That's it! You're now ready to use the Weather App. Run the Python script, and you'll 
    be able to fetch weather information for any location.

## 3. Usage
    - Examples: python
    Copy code
    # Import the WeatherApp class from the weather_app module
    from weather_app import WeatherApp

    # Create an instance of the WeatherApp class with your API key
    api_key = "your_api_key_here"
    app = WeatherApp(api_key)

    # Run the Weather App
    app.run()

    - Configuration: Before running the Weather App, make sure to replace 
      "your_api_key_here" with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key.
      You can customize the appearance of the GUI or add additional features by modifying 
      the code in the WeatherApp class

## 4. Features
    - Weather Data Retrieval: Fetch current weather information from the OpenWeatherMap 
      API.
      GUI Interface: Provide a user-friendly graphical interface built with Tkinter for easy interaction.
      
      Location Input: Allow users to input a location (e.g., city name) to retrieve weather data.
      
      Weather Details Display: Display weather details such as temperature, description,wind speed, and coordinates.
      
      Speech Synthesis: Utilize the win32com library to enable text-to-speech functionality for weather information.

## 5. Contributing
    - Guidelines: Bug Reports: If you encounter any bugs or issues while using the 
      weather App, please open a new issue on the project's GitHub repository. Provide 
      detailed information about the problem, including steps to reproduce it.
      
    Feature Requests: If you have ideas for new features or improvements, feel free to 
    submit a feature request on GitHub. Describe the feature you'd like to see and 
    explain why it would be beneficial.
    
    Code Contributions: We welcome contributions from the community! If you'd like to 
    contribute code to the Weather App, please fork the repository, make your changes,
    and submit a pull request. Ensure your code follows the project's coding standards 
    and includes appropriate documentation and tests.

    - Code Style: Follow PEP8 standards for Python code formatting, indentation, spacing, 
    and naming conventions. Use meaningful variable and function names to enhance code 
    readability. Include comments to explain complex logic or provide context where 
    necessary. When submitting code contributions, ensure your changes are well- 
    documented and thoroughly tested.
